TO DO:
- create picture for each project (can be all the same, or different based on area):
    - 1 picture about social impact
    - 1 logo (can be removed)
- nova logo white for the footer
- change the website and the address in the footer
- look at v-key problem in the pages
- DO REPORT

TO DISCUSS:
- how breadcrumbs works (if click go to link? show also current page?) only in area page - REMOVE THE LINK OF AREA PAGE BREADCRUMB
- PUT TRIANGLE IMAGE IN THE SUB DROPDOWN NAVIGATION BAR
- OVERFLOW OF THE COVER IMAGE IN HORIZONTAL SCROLLING
- AREA PAGE: CHANGE DESIGN OF THE AREA_SELECTOR, NO NEED OF CHANGE THE RELOAD BUT WRITE IN THE FUTURE IMPROVEMENT
- how form contact us works (missing parameter message, when to show hidden message) - ADD THE RESET THE FORM FUNCTION WHEN CLICK ON SUBMIT. Do a call to the server that responds with a 
200 status code (practically speaking a “Hello World”) and then you display the notification.
- scroll images: ADD SCROLL WITH MOUSE EVENT, 

1) finish the website
2) report
