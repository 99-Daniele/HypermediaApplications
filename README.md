TO DO:
- change the website and the address in the footer (what is that?)
- look at v-key problem in the pages
- look shadow of cards and general design of website (too much space at end of page? backbutton too distant?)
- DO REPORT
- width of page overflow
- resize page ??
- Do a call to the server that responds with a 200 status code (practically speaking a “Hello World”) and then you display the notification.
