TO DO:
- change the website and the address in the footer (what is that?)
- look at v-key problem in the pages
- look shadow of cards and general design of website (too much space at end of page? backbutton too distant?)
- ERROR PAGE
- DO REPORT

TO DISCUSS:
- OVERFLOW OF THE COVER IMAGE IN HORIZONTAL SCROLLING
- Do a call to the server that responds with a 200 status code (practically speaking a “Hello World”) and then you display the notification.

1) finish the website
2) design things
3) report
4) vercel
