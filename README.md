TO DO:
- create picture for each project (can be all the same, or different based on area):
    - 1 picture about social impact
    - 1 logo (can be removed)
- look at v-key problem in the pages
- do reports

TO DISCUSS:
- how breadcrumbs works (if click go to link? show also current page?) only in area page
- how form contact us works (missing parameter message, when to show hidden message)
- how area page works (retrieve all content and hide part of it, or retrieve only the one relevant to area?)
- Discuss the area page in javascript
- scroll images
